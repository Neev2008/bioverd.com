    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>
      BioVerd is revolutionising the way we think about electricity. By tapping into the natural bioelectric potential of plants, we create clean, renewable energy thatâ€™s capable of powering small devices like mobile phones, LED lights, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine charging your phone using your potted plant. Thatâ€™s no longer science fiction â€“ thatâ€™s BioVerd.

  <section class="how-it-works intro-section">
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
      Plants perform photosynthesis, producing energy. Some of that energy moves into the soil in the form of electrons. Our specialised system captures those electrons using harmless electrodes placed near the roots and converts it into usable DC electricity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's like a living battery that regenerates naturally, no pollution, no fumes â€“ just photosynthesis and innovation.

  <section class="get-started intro-section">
    <h2>Get Started</h2>
    <p>
      All you need is one of our kits and a plant you already have. In just minutes, youâ€™ll be able to set up your bio-generator and begin powering small appliances, completely off-grid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you're an eco-enthusiast, a student, or a teacher, BioVerd opens a new door into the future of green tech.
