    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      BioVerd is a forward-thinking initiative committed to bridging the gap between nature and technology. Founded by a team of eco-conscious innovators, we specialise in harnessing bio-electric energy from living plants to provide sustainable power for small-scale applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our work lies at the intersection of environmental science, electronics, and design. We aim to create accessible solutions that help reduce dependency on non-renewable resources while educating communities on the potential of plant-based energy.

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      We envision a future where everyday appliances can be powered by the very plants that surround us — clean, efficient, and harmonious with the environment. By promoting awareness and accessibility of green technologies, BioVerd seeks to inspire a global movement toward more responsible and innovative energy use.

    <h2>Our Journey</h2>
    <p>
      What began as a curiosity-driven project has grown into a grassroots energy solution. From school science fairs to eco-startup expos, BioVerd has demonstrated the viability of plant-powered energy systems across multiple platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      We continue to evolve through research, collaboration, and feedback from a growing community of users, educators, and green energy supporters.
    </p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
      BioVerd is not just a technology — it's a movement. In a world facing climate change, energy shortages, and ecological imbalance, we believe even the smallest innovations can have the greatest impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      With BioVerd, we invite you to grow more than just plants — grow awareness, grow sustainability, and grow the future.
